    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list of strings `operations`, where `operations[i]` is the `ith` operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An integer `x`.\n",
    "    - Record a new score of `x`.\n",
    "- `'+'`.\n",
    "    - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.\n",
    "- `'D'`.\n",
    "    - Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.\n",
    "- `'C'`.\n",
    "    - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return *the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a **32-bit** integer and that all operations are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: ops = [\"5\",\"2\",\"C\",\"D\",\"+\"]\n",
    "Output: 30\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\"5\" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].\n",
    "\"2\" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].\n",
    "\"C\" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].\n",
    "\"D\" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].\n",
    "\"+\" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].\n",
    "The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: ops = [\"5\",\"-2\",\"4\",\"C\",\"D\",\"9\",\"+\",\"+\"]\n",
    "Output: 27\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\"5\" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].\n",
    "\"-2\" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].\n",
    "\"4\" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].\n",
    "\"C\" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].\n",
    "\"D\" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].\n",
    "\"9\" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].\n",
    "\"+\" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].\n",
    "\"+\" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].\n",
    "The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: ops = [\"1\",\"C\"]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\"1\" - Add 1 to the record, record is now [1].\n",
    "\"C\" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [].\n",
    "Since the record is empty, the total sum is 0.\n",
    "```\n",
