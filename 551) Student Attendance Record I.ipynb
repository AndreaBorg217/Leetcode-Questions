    "You are given a string `s` representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'A'`: Absent.\n",
    "- `'L'`: Late.\n",
    "- `'P'`: Present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet **both** of the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The student was absent (`'A'`) for **strictly** fewer than 2 days **total**.\n",
    "- The student was **never** late (`'L'`) for 3 or more **consecutive** days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `true` *if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or* `false` *otherwise*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"PPALLP\"\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: The student has fewer than 2 absences and was never late 3 or more consecutive days.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"PPALLL\"\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "Explanation: The student was late 3 consecutive days in the last 3 days, so is not eligible for the award.\n",
    "```\n",
