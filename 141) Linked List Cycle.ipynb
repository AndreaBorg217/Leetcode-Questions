    "Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `true` *if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return `false`.\n",
